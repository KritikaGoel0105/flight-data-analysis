# ✈️ Flight Data Analysis

## 📊 Overview
This project performs data analysis on a flight dataset to explore patterns, understand trends, and derive useful insights about flight operations.  
It focuses on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python libraries.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore the structure of flight data.
- Clean and preprocess raw flight information.
- Visualize patterns such as flight frequency, duration, and distribution.
- Identify useful insights from the data.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Data loading and cleaning with **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- Summary statistics and correlation checks
- Insights about flight patterns (e.g., most frequent airlines, duration, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

## 📈 Example Insights
- Most flights are operated by a few major airlines.  
- Certain routes are more common than others.  
- The average flight duration varies depending on the distance covered.
